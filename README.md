## Part 1: WeatherPy

In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.

You'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated randoly Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

The output files needed for part 2 will be stored in the output data folder.

**Please make sure to insert your api key from OpenWeatherMap API in the api_keys.py file**

## Part 2: VacationPy

In this part, you'll use weather data provided by the previous code to plan yout future vacations. 

Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API in order to find the nearest hotel to your ideal vacation parameters.

Your main tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ your Python skills to create map visualizations.

As the interactive maps cannot be displayed by the github enviroment you must run the files in a Jupyter Notebook

However the maps obtained were saved in the vacation_plots folder


**Please make sure to insert your api key from GeoApify API in the api_keys.py file**
